Create a new directory and move into it:

> mkdir webpack-4-quickstart && cd $_


<hr>


Initialize a package.json by running:

> npm init -y


<hr>

and pull webpack 4 in:

> npm i webpack --save-dev


<hr>

We need webpack-cli also, which lives as a separate package:

> npm i webpack-cli --save-dev
